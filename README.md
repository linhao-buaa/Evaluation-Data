The test dataset is given in Flowlist_test
# Directory in this repository
Test2: The PIV images with different image parameters include particle diameter, seeding density, particle displacement and gaussian noise intensity

The three flow configures are single vortex (SV) flow, single-scale multiple vortex (SSMV) flow and multi-scale multiple vortex (MSMV)

Test3_rotorwake: Rotor wake vortices

Test3_hypersonic: Hypersonic flat-plate TBL
